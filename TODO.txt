- Be more responsible about pinging and ponging:
  - Send pings. [DONE]
  - Fail if no pongs.
- Set read and write deadlines.
- Server to detect which game a client wants.
- Server to reject a client request with no game/group specified.
- Put clients into a hub per group/game.
- Hub to remove itself from superhub when it has no clients.
- Ensure App Engine runs with only one instance.
- Queue messages in a channel, to reduce blocking.
- Close a client connection if ping doesn't get a response in time.
- Store game state locally.
- Add "other clients" list into server response.
- Add own client ID into server response.

DONE:

- Give clients an identifier (probably via a cookie).
- Refactor cookie client ID code into a Client type.
- Prove websockets connectivity.
- Generate client ID for websocket connection.
- Test that a real websocket client does send cookies as expected.
- Fixed: Bug: Client ID cookie is lost after browser closes (but not after tab
  closes). Likely due to Max-Age not being set (value in seconds).
- Make adding a client to a hub concurrency-safe.
- Allow removing of clients from a hub (concurrency-safely).
- Shift echoing into the client.
- Add a client to a hub when it's created.
- Have a client message bounce to other clients in a hub.
- Remove a client from hub when it leaves.
