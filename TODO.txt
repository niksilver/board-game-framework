- Allow removing of clients from a hub (concurrency-safely).
- Have a client message bounce to other clients in a hub.
- Client to tell the server which group/game it belongs to.
- Ensure App Engine runs with only one instance.
- Be more responsible about pinging and ponging.
- Queue messages in a channel, to reduce blocking.
- Close a client connection if ping doesn't get a response in time.
- Store game state locally.

DONE:

- Give clients an identifier (probably via a cookie).
- Refactor cookie client ID code into a Client type.
- Prove websockets connectivity.
- Generate client ID for websocket connection.
- Test that a real websocket client does send cookies as expected.
- Fixed: Bug: Client ID cookie is lost after browser closes (but not after tab
  closes). Likely due to Max-Age not being set (value in seconds).
- Make adding a client to a hub concurrency-safe.
